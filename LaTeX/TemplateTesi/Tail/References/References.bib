abstract = {From the (patho)physiological point of view, diseases can be considered as emergent properties of living systems stemming from the complexity of these systems. Complex systems display some typical features, including the presence of emergent behavior and the organization in successive hierarchic levels. Drug treatments increase this complexity scenario, and from some years the use of network models has been introduced to describe drug–disease systems and to make predictions about them with regard to several aspects related to drug discovery. Here, we review some recent examples thereof with the aim to illustrate how network science tools can be very effective in addressing both tasks. We will examine the use of bipartite networks that lead to the important concept of “disease module”, as well as the introduction of more articulated models, like multi-scale and multiplex networks, able to describe disease systems at increasing levels of organization. Examples of predictive models will then be discussed, considering both those that exploit approaches purely based on graph theory and those that integrate machine learning methods. A short account of both kinds of methodological applications will be provided. Finally, the point will be made on the present situation of modeling complex drug–disease systems highlighting some open issues.

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge problem of public health that requires the implementation of all available means to contrast it, and drugs are one of them. In this context, we observed an unmet need of depicting the continuously evolving scenario of the ongoing drug clinical trials through an easy-to-use, freely accessible online tool. Starting from this consideration, we developed COVIDrugNet ( http://compmedchem.unibo.it/covidrugnet ), a web application that allows users to capture a holistic view and keep up to date on how the clinical drug research is responding to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we describe the web app and show through some examples how one can explore the whole landscape of medicines in clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 and try to probe the consistency of the current approaches with the available biological and pharmacological evidence. We conclude that careful analyses of the COVID-19 drug-target system based on COVIDrugNet can help to understand the biological implications of the proposed drug options, and eventually improve the search for more effective therapies.},
